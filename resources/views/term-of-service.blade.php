                    <p>The Services are accessible through the Site. The Site and the Services are operated by Upcoming Sounds, registered in England and Wales &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and our registered office is at&nbsp;<strong>29-31 Parliament Street, Liverpool, England, L8 5RN</strong>.</p>
                    <p>(hereina&lt;er: "<strong>Upcomingsounds</strong>").</p>
                    <p>UpcomingSounds can be contacted at the following coordinates:</p>

                    </ul>
                   
                    <p>1.1. When you utilize our website ("Website") or our app, you are implicitly accepting these Terms of Use. If you disagree with these terms, you are prohibited from using our Website and/or App, and you should promptly discontinue such usage.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong></strong>.</p>
           
                     
                     <p>1.2. These Terms of Use might mention other third-party entities; however, their sole purpose is to govern your usage of this Website, and they do not pertain to any of those other entities except as explicitly stated herein.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong></strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>1.3. The purpose of the Upcomingsounds.com service is to cater to the requirements of artists and their representatives, such as PR companies ("Artists"), who seek reviews and coverage of their creative endeavors ("Work/s" or "Work"). Additionally, it aims to facilitate writers, journalists, commentators, bloggers, YouTubers, podcasters, and/or tastemakers (collectively referred to as "Content Curators"), who wish to produce written pieces, blogs, podcasts, webcasts, or broadcasts about Artists and/or their Work/s, or to curate their Work/s ("Reviews"). &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong></strong>.</p>
                    <p>  Artists who desire Reviews can submit their Work/s or releases to this Website following the guidelines outlined on the website, which may specify formats, size limits, and other details. Work/s may encompass audio and/or audio-visual recordings, videos, compositions, lyrics, photos, existing reviews and quotes, social media content, and any other materials pertinent to the Artist and potentially intriguing to Content Curators and the broader audience.</p>

                   
                          <p>1.4. By uploading their Work/s to the Website, the Artist is granting Upcomingsounds and Content Curators facilitated by Upcomingsounds the non-exclusive right to utilize the Work/s for Review purposes. This includes the rights to utilize the Artist's name/s, image/s, and all materials embodied in the Work/s for Reviews or to obtain Reviews. Additionally, by uploading Work/s, the Artist is also granting Upcomingsounds the right to store and electronically transmit the Work/s to Content Curators for the purpose of obtaining Reviews. Upcomingsounds retains the right (but not the obligation) to feature any uploaded Work/s in a Upcomingsounds playlist designed for Content Curators' attention. Through uploading the Work/s, the Artist grants  Upcomingsounds a non-exclusive license to include the Work/s on such playlists without requiring payment or further formality. Upcomingsounds may also create Reviews of the Work/s or make minor alterations to the Work/s to facilitate reviews, such as editing an Artist biography. </p>
               
                        
                 <p>1.5. By uploading Work/s to the Website, the Artist assures that they possess complete rights and permissions to upload such Work/s (including all its components) and to grant the rights as outlined to Upcomingsounds and/or Content Curators herein. The Artist further warrants that the Work/s will not violate the rights of any third parties (including copyrights and/or trademarks) and hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold harmless Upcomingsounds and/or Content Curators from any and all damages and liabilities (including legal fees) resulting from any breach by the Artist of the warranties stated herein. </p>
              
                      <p>1.6. Upcomingsounds will exert reasonable efforts to obtain Reviews for uploaded Work/s. If Upcomingsounds determines that the Artist's Work/s are incomplete or otherwise unsuitable for Reviews, Upcomingsounds team will make an effort to communicate this assessment to the Artist. However, Upcomingsounds does not offer any warranty or assurance regarding its ability to secure Reviews for the Artist's uploaded Work/s. In cases where an Artist has utilized the Upcomingsounds Paid Service (defined as any service where the Artist has consented to make a monetary contribution to a Content Curator to attract the Content Curator’s attention, as periodically outlined on the Website), Upcomingsounds will refund the USC credits used as payment to the Artist within 90 days of the initial payment, serving as the Artist's sole recourse. It's important to note that Upcomingsounds will not refund payments received from artists or artist representatives/agencies using electronic payment methods such as Apple Pay, Stripe Checkout, PayPal, or any other similar method. Instead, Upcomingsounds will only refund credits to the artist's wallet https://upcomingsounds.com/wallet , which can be utilized for future campaigns or verified curator submissions. </p>  
                  
                        <p>1.7. Upcomingsounds does not make any warranty as to the nature of any Review, coverage or any feature from any cuartor. </p>  
                         
                       
                             <p>1.8. Artists may request (via written communication) that Upcomingsounds should delete any of the Artist’s Work/s. Upcomingsounds will undertake such deletion within 30 days of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Upcomingsounds is unable to ensure the deletion of the Work/s communicated to and held by or reviewed by Content Curators. </p>  
                         
                             
                           <p>1.9. Content Curators have the option to sign up as users on Upcomingsounds following the procedures communicated on the Website. Upcomingsounds reserves the right to refuse registration to any Content Curator at its discretion.</p> 

                    <p>1.10. After registration, Content Creators gain access to Upcomingsounds playlists showcasing Artists’ Work/s and have the opportunity to engage in the Upcomingsounds Paid Service. This involves making an offer to an Artist to Review their Work in exchange for a monetary contribution from the Artist towards the Content Curator’s time and expenses. Upcomingsounds carefully evaluates all such offers to maintain the integrity of the Paid Service, ensuring that the monetary amounts are reasonable token contributions for the Content Curator’s efforts and not inflated or tied to positive reviews, thus avoiding any semblance of payola. Any offer that deviates from this principle will be blocked. The Paid Service aims to alleviate the significant financial challenges faced by many individual Content Curators. Therefore, while companies like Spotify, YouTube, or radio stations can utilize Upcomingsounds for Reviews, they are ineligible to use the Paid Service, meaning they cannot make offers to artists requesting contributions of any kind. </p>  
                    
                    <p>1.11. If an Artist accepts an offer from a Content Curator, they will make the agreed contribution to Upcomingsounds using USC Credits, which can be purchased from the artist's wallet using Stripe or PayPal checkout payments, following the specified payment procedure on the Website. </p> 

Upcomingsounds will then retain the payment until the Content Curator provides evidence that the Review/work has been completed according to the terms of the Artist's offer.

Once confirmation is received and the process has been completed,  the curator will receive the USC. Subsequently, Upcomingsounds will transfer the payment to the Content Curator, deducting a service charge ranging from 5% to 22%, along with handling fees. The exact percentage of this service charge may vary and will be clearly outlined on the Website. </p> 
                    <p>1.12. Upcomingsounds will inform the Content Curator upon the Artist's acceptance of an offer and payment to Upcomingsounds. However, Upcomingsounds holds no responsibility toward the Content Curator if the Artist fails to fulfill the agreed payment or comply with the terms outlined in the Content Curator's offer. </p>
